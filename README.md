A collection of links and information about coffee.

## Beans

I'm usually order at the following roasteries. I like medium roasted beans, especially from Ethiopia.

- [The Barn](https://thebarn.de/) in Berlin.
- [jb Kaffee](http://jbkaffee.de ) also in Berlin.
- [Five Elephant](https://www.fiveelephant.com/) - another one from Berlin. They have great beans but the packaging is not resealable.
- [quijote kaffee](https://www.quijote-kaffee.de/shop/filterkaffee) in Hamburg. This is the cheapest supplier, but they only have a few filter coffees in their catalog. Packaging is not resealable.
- [Mahlefitz](http://www.mahlefitz.de/) in Munich.
- [Machhoerndl Kaffee](https://www.machhoerndl-kaffee.de/) also in Munich.

I haven't ordert at [Benson Coffee](https://benson.coffee/) but I heard that it is pretty good as well. [Kaffeezentrale](https://www.kaffeezentrale.de/) is a redistributor for several roasteries.

## Brewing

I follow the [brewing guide by Benjamin Ritzhammer](https://gist.github.com/benjmin-r/cf329baf0af88ddfe2bc830d1656e6cb). The [coffee brewing compass](https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/the-coffee-compass) helped a lot with getting started.
